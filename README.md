# Python
This study focus mostly on ensemble learning and assessing the results of three classification models to 
predict students' performance, as well as using hyperparameter tuning to improve accuracy. The 
model's performance was greatly aided by feature engineering and data encoding. SMOTE and Random 
Undersampling were used to overcome the class imbalance problem and produce good results. 
GridSearchCV improves ensemble classifier performance by tweaking hyperparameters.Random Forest 
Classifier produces better accuracy than others model consistently.SVM SMOTE also performed well.
